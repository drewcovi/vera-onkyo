## Scope ##

This is an extension of the plugin posted by @guessed on the Micasaverde forums in 2011. Since then other authors have improved the plugin, but I have not kept track of the changes. This fork is therefore probably quite outdated and certainly not very elegent. I'd advise you check the new Onkyo plugin in the Mios App store out instead of using this.
